# We want a specific order of keys in restylers.yaml, since it's effectively
# documentation. This helper uses Ruby, which preserves Hash insertion order
# through to the resulting YAML, as a way to re-order the keys to what we want
# after we've processed everything in a better (gasp!) language.
#
# Examples:
#
#   % cat something.yaml
#   bar: false
#   foo:
#     - true
#
#   % build/sort-yaml something.yaml foo bar && cat something.yaml
#   foo:
#     - true
#   bar: false
#
# We only support re-sorting a top-level Object's keys, or an Array of such.
